# Synesis — Visual Identity System
*Creative Direction: Pentagram*
*Version 1.0 — February 2026*

## 1. LOGO CONCEPTS

### Direction A — Wordmark

**Concept: "The Compiled Name"**

The wordmark renders SYNESIS in Newsreader Display at a specific optical size, with a single typographic intervention: the letter **S** is set in IBM Plex Mono weight, creating a visible shift in construction — serif transitions to monospace at the initial character.

```
S Y N E S I S
↑
IBM Plex Mono S  |  Newsreader Display Y-N-E-S-I-S
```

*Strategic rationale:* The wordmark itself demonstrates the brand's core proposition — the meeting of human language and formal structure. The initial S in mono weight acts as a compiler "entry point," the glyph where the DSL begins. Subtle enough to read as a design decision; precise enough to reward attention. No symbol needed — the typography is the concept.

---

### Direction B — Symbol / Icon

**Concept: "The Dependency Graph"**

A minimal geometric mark: three nodes arranged in an asymmetric hierarchy — one root node above, connected by directed edges to two child nodes below. The nodes are precise circles; the edges are ruled lines with optional terminal arrowheads in the icon version.

```
        ●
       / \
      /   \
     ●     ●
```

The proportions follow a **golden ratio** column grid. Node radius, edge weight, and overall mark height are related by the ratio 1:1.618.

*Strategic rationale:* The graph structure is the native metaphor of Synesis — knowledge as a network of anchored, directed relationships. Three nodes suggest the minimum viable graph: a claim, its source, and its relationship. It is simultaneously a dependency graph, a citation network, and a logical derivation tree. Universally legible in icon form (app icon, favicon, embossed hardware).

*Variants:* The three nodes can be filled (default), outlined (monochrome), or replaced with numerals 1–2–3 (onboarding contexts).

---

### Direction C — Combination Mark

**Concept: "Structured & Named"**

The symbol (Direction B graph) sits to the left of the wordmark (Direction A), vertically centered to the cap height of the S. The graph mark uses the primary color; the wordmark uses dark neutral. The relationship between symbol and text mirrors the relationship between structure and meaning — the graph gives the name its formal backbone.

```
  ●
 / \  SYNESIS
●   ●
```

*Strategic rationale:* The combination mark is the primary logo for most applications. It gives the brand both immediate recognition (symbol) and linguistic clarity (wordmark). The symbol alone serves app stores, favicons, and embossed applications. The wordmark alone serves typographic contexts (book spines, monochrome press). The combination serves marketing, documentation, and product surfaces.

## 3. LOGO USAGE RULES

### Correct Applications

1. **Full combination mark on white background** — primary use in all marketing materials
2. **Symbol alone as app icon** — on square or rounded-square container, Primary Blue on white
3. **Wordmark alone in document headers** — for internal or academic publications where symbol is redundant
4. **Reversed combination on Primary Navy** — hero sections, dark mode UI, presentation covers
5. **Monochrome on tactile surfaces** — embossing, letterpress, single-color print

### Incorrect Applications — DO NOT

1. **Do not** stretch, compress, or distort any element of the mark in any dimension
2. **Do not** use the symbol in Accent Amber on light backgrounds — Amber is reserved for reversed/dark contexts only
3. **Do not** place the logo over busy photography without a clear zone (use a dark overlay at minimum 60% opacity)
4. **Do not** recreate the wordmark in any typeface other than the exact Newsreader Display specification
5. **Do not** add drop shadows, gradients, glows, or decorative effects to any logo variant

## 5. TYPOGRAPHY

### System Overview

```
PRIMARY     →  Newsreader          (Optical sizes: Caption / Text / Display)
SECONDARY   →  IBM Plex Sans       (Weights: Light 300 / Regular 400 / Medium 500 / SemiBold 600)
TECHNICAL   →  IBM Plex Mono       (Weights: Regular 400 / Italic 400i)
```

All three fonts are available under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).
All three are available on Google Fonts and as self-hosted variable fonts.

### Primary Typeface — Newsreader

**Source:** Google Fonts / Production Type
**License:** SIL OFL
**Variable axes:** Optical Size (6–72), Weight (200–800)

*Strategic rationale:* Newsreader is an editorial serif designed explicitly for on-screen continuous reading in content-rich environments. Its high contrast, generous x-height, and three optical sizes (Caption, Text, Display) provide a complete hierarchy from body copy to hero headlines within a single typeface. Its print-referencing DNA anchors Synesis in the scholarly tradition; its screen-first engineering ensures performance in documentation and product UI.

#### Usage Hierarchy

| Level | Optical Size | Weight | Size | Leading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hero / Display | Display (72pt+) | 300 Light | 64–96px | 1.1 |
| Section Headlines | Display | 400 Regular | 40–56px | 1.15 |
| Article H1 | Text | 600 SemiBold | 32px | 1.2 |
| Article H2 | Text | 500 Medium | 24px | 1.3 |
| Article H3 | Text | 400 Regular Italic | 20px | 1.35 |
| Body / Long-form | Text | 400 Regular | 16–18px | 1.6 |
| Captions | Caption | 400 Regular | 12–13px | 1.5 |
| Pull Quotes | Display | 300 Light Italic | 28–36px | 1.25 |

---

### Secondary Typeface — IBM Plex Sans

**Source:** Google Fonts / IBM
**License:** SIL OFL

*Strategic rationale:* IBM Plex Sans shares the same superfamily as IBM Plex Mono, ensuring visual coherence between interface text and code. Its humanist construction (visible in the curved terminals and ink-trap details) prevents the sterility common in geometric sans-serifs, while its extensive weight range supports complex UI hierarchy.

#### Usage Hierarchy

| Level | Weight | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Navigation | SemiBold 600 | 14px | Primary nav items |
| UI Labels | Medium 500 | 13–14px | Buttons, form labels |
| Body Interface | Regular 400 | 14–15px | Tooltips, modals, metadata |
| Supporting Text | Light 300 | 12–13px | Timestamps, version numbers |
| ALL CAPS Tags | Medium 500 | 10–11px / +0.08em tracking | Status badges, category pills |

---

### Technical Typeface — IBM Plex Mono

**Source:** Google Fonts / IBM
**License:** SIL OFL

*Strategic rationale:* IBM Plex Mono carries the compiler identity of Synesis. Every instance of `.syn` syntax, terminal output, or file extension rendered in Mono reinforces the DSL concept at the visual level. The distinctive Italic variant (with its flowing, calligraphic character) humanizes code without compromising precision — an appropriate gesture for a tool that sits at the boundary of human thought and machine processing.

#### Usage Hierarchy

| Context | Style | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code blocks | Regular 400 | 14px | Full DSL syntax examples |
| Inline code | Regular 400 | 90% of surrounding body | `@claim`, `.syn`, method names |
| File extensions | Regular 400 | Match label size | `.syn` `.synt` `.syno` `.synp` |
| Terminal output | Regular 400 | 13px | Compiler messages |
| Variable references | Italic 400i | Match context | Annotation variables in prose |

## 6. IMAGERY STYLE

### Photography Guidelines

**Mood:** Contemplative precision. Not sterile laboratory — the quiet focus of a scholar at work, where thought and tool meet.

**Lighting:** Natural, directional. Soft raking light across surfaces. Minimal artificial lighting. Warm color temperature (3200–4000K equivalent). High dynamic range — detail in shadows.

**Subjects:**
- Hands at work: writing, annotating, typing — never posed, always mid-process
- Analog-digital hybrid: open notebooks beside terminals, printed papers with margin notes
- Environments: research spaces, libraries, seminar rooms, home offices — authentic clutter is allowed
- Human presence: researchers photographed from behind or in profile — the work is the protagonist, not the face
- Texture: paper grain, pencil marks, book spines, printed code — physical evidence of intellectual work

**Composition:** Rule of thirds. Generous negative space. Shallow depth of field — one plane of sharp focus. Never symmetrical. Frame within frame (open books, doorways, window light).

**What to avoid:** Stock-photo happiness, generic "technology" imagery (floating holograms, LED-lit server rooms), posed collaboration shots.

---

### Illustration Style

**Style:** Precise technical line illustration. Single-color or two-color. References scientific diagrams, information architecture drawings, and early computer science publications.

**Line weight:** 1.5px base stroke, consistent throughout. No variable stroke weight in icons.

**Elements:** Graph nodes and directed edges, tree structures, formal notation symbols, document schemas. All derived from the brand's conceptual vocabulary.

**Color application:** Primary Navy lines on white, or white lines on Primary Navy. Occasional Compiler Amber for active nodes or highlighted relationships.

---

### Iconography Style

**Grid:** 24×24px base (48×48 @2x)
**Line weight:** 1.5px stroke
**Corner radius:** 2px on rectangular forms, 0 on graph nodes
**Fill rules:** Outlined by default; filled variant for active/selected states
**Style:** Geometric, not decorative. Every icon is a diagram, not a picture.

**Icon families:**
- Document/file icons: `.syn`, `.synt`, `.syno`, `.synp` — each with distinct corner treatment
- Graph operations: node, edge, cluster, merge, split
- Compiler states: valid, warning, error, pending
- Navigation: export, import, version, annotate, anchor

---

### Graphic Element Patterns

**The Grid Pattern:** A subtle dot grid (1px dots at 24px intervals) in `#E5E1DA` (Paper Tint) — references graph paper, coordinate systems, and the structured substrate of Synesis. Used as background texture in marketing materials and section dividers.

**The Directed Edge:** A single ruled line with arrowhead — the visual atom of the knowledge graph. Used decoratively in pull quotes, section transitions, and as a bullet replacement in high-emphasis lists.

**The Annotation Mark:** A bracket symbol `[ ]` in IBM Plex Mono, used as a decorative frame for highlighted statistics, pull quotes, and featured proof points in marketing materials.
