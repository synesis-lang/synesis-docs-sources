## Using the Explorers

### References

- Use the refresh button when files change
- Use the filter to quickly find a reference

### Codes
- Shows codes found in your data
- Use refresh and filter the same way

![Codes with code list.](../../images/06_codes.png)

### Relations
- Shows relations (chains) found
- If it doesn't appear, check if there are `chain:` fields in annotation files (.syn)

## Quick tips

- If something doesn't update, click refresh
- Word Wrap is automatically enabled for easier reading
- Use the filter to reduce large lists

---

## Common problems

**I don't see anything in the panel**
- Check if the project folder was opened in VS Code
- Check if there are `.syn` files in the folder

**Relations don't appear**
- Check if there are `chain:` lines in the files

## Ready to use

With this, you can now navigate, filter, and visualize your Synesis data directly in VS Code.
