# Welcome to Synesis

Human knowledge is inherently intricate, full of nuances and deep connections. This is complexity — and it is valuable. Complication arises only when we lack adequate methods for organizing knowledge.

**Synesis** is a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) created for those who need more than simple notes. It is a method of **knowledge consolidation**.

Unlike traditional tools, Synesis acts as a compiler for your analytical thinking: it receives your interpretations and annotations in plain text files, validates logical consistency between them, and transforms them into canonical and rigorous knowledge structures.

Often, it is believed that technical rigor stifles creativity. Synesis proves the opposite: **discipline is the true form of freedom.** By delegating logical organization to a canonical structure, your mind is free for what truly matters: interpretation, nuance, and *insight*.

## How it works

Synesis structure is modular and entirely based on **plain text**, offering a distraction-free environment, total portability, and maximum efficiency.

The entire process is orchestrated by a project file (`.synp`), which connects its components:

* **Bibliographic References (`.bib`)**: Your original sources.
* **Interpretive Annotations (`.syn`)**: Your insights, standardized by templates (`.synt`).
* **Ontologies (`.syno`)**: The major differentiator — files that formally define your analysis categories and logical interrelations.

### The Compilation Flow

When compiling these files, Synesis validates concept consistency and generates universal outputs.

### The Power of Integration

The result of Synesis compilation goes far beyond static documents. The compiler transforms your definitions into universal exchange formats (JSON, Excel, CSV), making your knowledge integrable with any tech stack:

* **Graph Databases**: Natively feed Neo4j or Memgraph to visualize the complex topology of your concepts.

* **Data Science**: Provide structured datasets for rigorous statistical analyses in R or visualizations in Jupyter Labs.

* **AI Ready**: Through the MCP (Model Context Protocol), connect your data to assistants like Claude Desktop, enabling natural language interactions with 100% traceable responses based on your "source of truth".

## The Origin of the Name

From the Greek *σύνεσις* (sýnesis):

>**Etymology**: **σῠνῑ́ημῐ** (*sŭnī́ēmĭ*, "to bring together", "to make converge") + suffix **-σῐς** (*-sĭs*).

**Meanings:**
1. Confluence; union; convergence.
2. Understanding; intelligence.
3. Consciousness.

The result is true *sýnesis*: the convergence of information fragments into an intelligible, auditable, and technically structured whole.
