# Welcome to Synesis

Human knowledge is inherently intricate, full of nuances and deep connections. This is complexity — and it is valuable. Complication arises only when we lack adequate methods for organizing knowledge.

**Synesis** is a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) created for those who need more than simple notes. It is a method of **knowledge consolidation**.

Unlike traditional tools, Synesis acts as a compiler for your analytical thinking: it receives your interpretations and annotations in plain text files, validates logical consistency between them, and transforms them into canonical and rigorous knowledge structures.

Often, it is believed that technical rigor stifles creativity. Synesis proves the opposite: **discipline is the true form of freedom.** By delegating logical organization to a canonical structure, your mind is free for what truly matters: interpretation, nuance, and *insight*.
The result is true *sýnesis*: the convergence of information fragments into an intelligible, auditable, and technically structured whole.

## The Origin of the Name

From the Greek *σύνεσις* (sýnesis):

>**Etymology**: **σῠνῑ́ημῐ** (*sŭnī́ēmĭ*, "to bring together", "to make converge") + suffix **-σῐς** (*-sĭs*).

**Meanings:**
1.  Confluence; union; convergence.
2.  Understanding; intelligence.
3.  [cite_start]Consciousness.

## How it works

Synesis structure is modular and entirely based on **plain text**, offering a distraction-free environment, total portability, and maximum efficiency.

The entire process is orchestrated by a project file (`.synp`), which connects its components:

* **Bibliographic References (`.bib`)**: Your original sources.
* **Interpretive Annotations (`.syn`)**: Your insights, standardized by templates (`.synt`).
* **Ontologies (`.syno`)**: The major differentiator — files that formally define your analysis categories and logical interrelations.

### Syntax Example

You identify a knowledge source and create semantic blocks that connect segments from the original source with your systematic interpretation:

```synesis
SOURCE @interview_01
END SOURCE

ITEM @interview_01
    quote: "The cost is too high for me"
    note: Economic barrier to adoption
    chain: Cost -> INHIBITS -> Adoption
END ITEM
```

This approach elevates your annotations to the level of structured data. Daily writing is intuitive and you don't need to be a programmer to annotate; basic coding logic is only needed if you decide to build your own analysis structures (*templates*). Think of the *template* file as a contract, an agreement you establish for your annotations and the compiler. You can revise/expand/update this contract as your research progresses.

## The Compilation Flow
When compiling these files, Synesis verifies concept consistency and generates universal outputs.

### The Power of Integration

The result of Synesis compilation goes far beyond static documents. The compiler transforms your definitions into universal interchange formats (JSON, Excel, CSV), making your knowledge integrable with any technology stack:

* **Graph Databases**: Natively feed Neo4j or Memgraph to visualize the complex topology of your concepts.

* **Data Science**: Provide structured datasets for rigorous statistical analysis in R or visualizations in Jupyter Labs.

* **AI Ready**: Through the MCP protocol (Model Context Protocol), connect your data to assistants like Claude Desktop, enabling natural language interactions with 100% traceable responses based on your "source of truth".

## What Synesis is NOT

* **It's not Software Programming**: Although it uses engineering concepts, you don't need to "know how to program". Synesis is a **declarative** language: you describe *what* you know, not *how* the computer should process it. It's knowledge markup, not app development.
* **It's not a Notepad**: Note-taking tools prioritize capture speed and visual flexibility. Synesis prioritizes **logical consistency and canonical structure**. While notes accept contradictions, Synesis validates and resolves them.
* **It's not a "Walled Garden"**: CAQDAS software packages are excellent, but often lock your data in proprietary formats. Synesis is **"Code-First" and interoperable**: your data are open text files, versionable (Git) and compilable to any other system.

## Synesis Place in Your Stack

Synesis was designed to be the **missing link** between qualitative research and data science, without trying to replace specialized tools:

* **It doesn't analyze statistics, it feeds them:** Synesis doesn't calculate regressions, but generates structured datasets (`.csv`, `.json`) that allow R or Python to perform quantitative analysis on qualitative data with absolute precision.
* **It's not an AI "Black Box":** Unlike AIs that magically summarize texts (and hallucinate), Synesis offers *grounding*. It is the manual truth structure that serves as backing for AI to operate safely.
* **It doesn't replace human reading:** It is a formalization tool. The interpretation remains yours; Synesis ensures that this interpretation is systematic and auditable.
